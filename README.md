# (WIP) go-te ðŸ’¨
te(Tiny Expect) is a tiny test library for go.

## Note
te is not recommended for use, although I have using it myself in very limited circumstances.  
(This one was created with a bit of an idea in mind).

It also does not have all the features needed for testing, so please use it for fun only.

## Install
Please install it to perform the test with the command `go-te`.

```sh
go install github.com/shinshin86/go-te@latest
```

It must then be added to the project to be used.

```sh
go get github.com/shinshin86/go-te
```
